# Sprint Report (May 1-10, 2019)

Stated ESIP Lab Goals:

- (a) Automating package dependency updates
- (b) Automating ABI rebuilds

The conda-forge core members participated in the packaging summit [1],
organized by the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA),
during PyCon-19. PyCon 2019 happened in Cleveland Ohio from May 1st to 10th.
The members attending the meeting were: Anthony Scopatz, sponsored by QuanSight,
Michael Sarahan and Jonathan Helmus, both sponsored by AnacondaInc,
and Filipe Fernandes, sponsored by ESIP.

The discussion was very productive and it was interesting to see that the PyPA is adopting some packaging practices that are common to many package managers,
like adding a SAT solver to pip,
suffixing build numbers in wheels files names,
providing a way to "yank" a package from PyPI,
and provide package variants like numpy build with openblas or mkl,
all of those features are already present in conda-forge!

The discussed topics can be found in the meeting note [2].
The one that is of interested for the ESIPFed lab incubator project goal (a) is: "better metadata in the PyPI packages to facilitate third party packaging."
That will allow us to properly automate the package dependencies update even when a package depends on the presence of a system dependency that is not installable with pip.
Unfortunately the required changes will not be available in the near future.
Conda-forge will have to workaround those limitations for now.
The plan is to add the auto-update of the dependencies to pure python packages only, using the current metadata scheme.

The team also worked on refining the ABI migration infrastructure: the Conda-Forge Enhancement Proposal 09 (CFEP-09) [3].
This CFEP proposes a change to how our internal pinning system works.
The new system will comprise of a new repository for proposed migrations.
To propose a migration a PR will be issued with a new version of the global pinning file and some metadata about the migration needed (if any).
Once the PR is squashed and merged the bot will take the metadata to calculate which packages need to be rebuilt and start issuing PRs with the new pinning as a local pinning file to the feedstocks in topological order.
A prototype for this functionality is implemented in [4].
Once that is merge goal (b) of the proposal will be complete.

Last but not least the team also worked on issuing a few ABI migrations.
The one of interested to the ESIP community was the proj.4 6.1.0 pin [5],
which triggered the updates in [6-16].
