# Sprint Report (April 2-5, 2019)

Stated ESIP Lab Goals:

- Automating package dependency updates
- Automating ABI rebuilds

The conda-forge core members worked on infrastructure improvements within the scope of the ESIPLab incubator grant.
The team focused on "(2) Automating ABI rebuilds",
this task was prioritized in lieu of "(1) Automating package dependency updates" due to its was the urgency to keep the conda-forge channel stable and updated with the latest Software pinning.

Conda-forge migrations are changes in the conda-forge software stack that happen in topological order (builds obey the dependency chain).
One example was the compiler migration where all packages were rebuilt to use the new gcc7 compiler.
Other examples include building new packages for ARM and POWER architectures.
This will also may come up when building GPU packages.
All the current migrations can be followed in conda-forge's status page
[1](https://conda-forge.org/status).

One specific change that happens often is the re-pinning of the stack,
for example upgrading the `openssl` used in the builds.
This is particularly important when there are security issues and the stack must be rebuilt as soon as possible.
However, such a task can be tedious and difficult to perform without automation.
That is why conda-forge is developing tools to facilitate these migrations associated with the re-pin/update of a key dependency of the software stack.

The discussion on how to manage migrations and its design is happening in a conda-forge pull request
[2](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-enhancement-proposals/pull/13).
The pull request will allow for multiple migrations to happen in parallel,
so one update does not prevent the other from happening and locking the process.

At the moment conda-forge has several re-pin/ABI update migrations running:
`openssl` [3](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/454),
`libprotobuf` [4](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/479), and
`blas2` [5](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/480).
Issues were identified and fixed along the way,
for example: better branch name to identify the bot PRs
[6](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/455),
simplification to the rebuild migrator
[7](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/459),
accommodate blas version [8](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/483),
and use `doctr` to push commits to GitHub automatically
[9](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/471).

The migration machinery is documented with examples
[10](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/472) and
[11](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/474),
the status is saved in order to produce the status page
[12](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/485).

The sprint was a great opportunity to hash out what was done so far and plan where to focus our efforts next.
There was also some actual "hacking" of course.
The dependency graph database was updated to a JSON instead of pickle for better performance
[13](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/489) and
[14](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/490) and a new migrator was fired up
[15](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/492).
One example of an important migration is the Geospatial proj4 migration
[16](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/pull/217) and
[17](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts/pull/495).

What is next? While the migrator is working and the process of adding new migrations has been reduced to a PR with the new pin,
conda-forge still needs to converge on CFEP-09 [2] for running multiple migrations.

The other goal of the ESIPLab proposal,
"Automating package dependency updates" is currently under development.
Some issues were already identified: full recipe regeneration (version, dependencies, and metadata) vs. only version and dependencies;
what tool should be the canonical way to regenerate (conda-build skeleton vs a new independent tool).
The short term goal is to write a simple script that will augment the current bot update message with the new dependencies.
The long term goal, a full recipe regeneration tool, is probably out of scope for the ESIPLab work.
